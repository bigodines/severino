As a user
I want to be able to visit the Yahoo! page
So that I can see if it is working

Scenario 1 - Main Page
Given
    I go to Yahoo Page
When
    I see "search field" element
    And I fill "search field" textbox with "severino rocks"
    And I click "search button" element and wait
Then
   I see "severino rocks - Yahoo! Search Resultados da busca" title
   And I take a screenshot
